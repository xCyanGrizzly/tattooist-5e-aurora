      <p>The tattooist&quot;s tools are a type of artisan&quot;s tools consisting of two main components - the hammer and chisel. The chisel contains a simple mechanism that can twist to clasp onto needles of various widths. The hammer can act as an activator when it strikes the chisel, temporarily applying a magnetic property unique to magically-imbued inks into the needle. </p>
      <p class="indent">One of the main uses of tattooist&quot;s tools in regards to magic tattoos is extraction. An individual holds the chisel affixed with an empty needle against an enchanted sketchbook page or skin upon which a magic tattoo is applied. The wielder then taps the opposite end of the chisel, drawing the tattoo design inside of the affixed, empty needle.</p>
      <p class="indent">The tattooist&quot;s tools also include plenty of needles and medical supplies for sterilization. This is necessary in case the tattooist&quot;s tools are used to apply mundane tattoos as well. For non-magical tattoo applications, the chisel&quot;s needle can be dipped into the appropriate pigments and then hammered against an individual&quot;s skin, scales, or feathers to ink a tattoo.</p>
