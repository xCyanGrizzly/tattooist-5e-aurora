			<p>With nothing but their wits, will, and fists, pugilists lay it all on the table every time they’re in for a scrap. No strangers to adversity, pugilists can dish it out, take a licking and still keep coming back for more. A pugilist’s unbreakable spirit and talent for fisticuffs don’t come from rigorous training or high minded philosophies but are the hard won trophies of never backing down from a fight no matter the odds.</p>
			<p>All pugilists belong to a Fight Club, an informal fraternity of brawlers with similar style, that shapes the way they fight. Fight Clubs included in the full version of the Pugilist class are: Arena Royale, Bloodhound Bruisers, Dog &amp; Hound, Hand of Dread, Piss &amp; Vinegar, the Squared Circle, and the Sweet Science. Whether you’re interested in playing an adventuring luchador, a boxer fighting the good fight, or a hard-nosed detective with a penchant for pugilism, these Fight Clubs have you covered!</p>

    <description>
      <p>A chubby dwarf chuckles while applying the last drops of baleful ink onto his hammer, ensuring that his strike inflicts an extra dose of pain upon his unwitting target.</p>
      <p class="indent">A deft-fingered gnome finishes her design with a final flourish of golden ink. Concentrating, she lifts the swirls from the page, decorating her fingertips with a few quick strokes.</p>
      <p class="indent">The tattoo on the elf&quot;s arm began to glimmer as she places a steady hand upon her companion. Playful wisps of arcane energy dances around them, as the tattoo slides slowly from her onto the weary human—bestowing him with the means and magic to bring down the fearsome creature looming above.</p>
      <p class="indent">hile her party rests, the tattooist works in the dying campfire light to sketch intricate tattoo designs in hopes of empowering her companions. In the heat of battle, a tattooist manipulates magic and ink to empower attacks, distribute mystical tattoos on the fly, and conceive new designs based on the arcane spellslinging of her opponents.</p>
      <h4>VERSATILE DUELISTS</h4>
      <p>Just as tattooists blur the line between artist and magician, so too can they occupy multiple niches on the battlefield. As keen observers will instantly recognize, tattooists have an uncanny vitality mystically fortified by their craft. Many tattooists do their best fighting on the frontlines, shrugging off some nasty hits in the process. While not as devoted to the practice of magical arts as most spellcasters, their ability to comprehend the intricacies of magic and incorporate the arsenal of others into their own is a formidable and perplexing challenge for their opponents.</p>
      <h4>GROUNDBREAKING DESIGNS</h4>
      <p>An adventuring party can be sure that a tattooist in their midst will do their utmost to carry their weight. As they struggle and persevere with the group, the selection of magic tattoos that tattooists are able to understand and produce expands in tandem.</p>
      <p class="indent">Tattooists will often strive to improve themselves and their craft in different ways. Some may seek apprenticeship under proven virtuosos. Others may be aware of their genius and push forward on their own towards discoveries that change their profession in unfathomable ways. Ultimately, however, most tattooists are devoted to fashioning designs that can move the hearts and minds of others with both their beauty and their magical potential.</p>
      <h4>CREATING A TATTOOIST</h4>
      <p>As you create a tattooist, it is essential to consider the path you took and what compels your character to move forward. Are you self-taught, or did you have a legendary mentor? What sort of style have you adopted and how does this influence you beyond your artwork? What sets you apart from your peers?</p>
      <p class="indent">Perhaps you were begrudgingly mentored by a skilled tattooist, who imparted to you knowledge that would have confounded a less capable apprentice. Maybe you were looking for a way to remain an artist while still braving the dangers that exist around every corner of this world. Or conceivably, you wish to journey to enrich your work, all the while building up your list of future clientele.</p>
      <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
      <p>You can make a tattooist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the acolyte background.</p>
      <h4>MULTICLASSING AND THE TATTOOIST</h4>
      <p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing, here&quot;s what you need to know if you choose the tattooist as one of your classes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ability Score Minimum.</b> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Constitution score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a tattooist.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Proficiencies Gained.</b> If the tattooist isn&quot;t your initial class, you gain the following proficiencies when you take your first level as a tattooist: light armor, painter&quot;s supplies, and tattooist&quot;s tools.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Spellcasting.</b> Add half your levels (rounded up) in the tattooist class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots. The number of spellbangers you apply on your body (as well as their spell level) remains tied to your individual level in the tattooist class.</p>
      <p class="indent">Your list of learned spells that can be turned into spellbangers as a tattooist are completely separate from the spells you know and are able to prepare from other classes. </p>
      <p class="indent">You can not create spellbangers for spells other than the two you obtain at the first level as a tattooist, and spells successfully observed using your Sketchy Imitation feature. </p>
      <p class="indent">You also can&quot;t use spell slots to cast the two spells you learn to convert into spellbangers at the first level as a tattooist, or spells successfully observed using your Sketchy Imitation feature. If the spell is also a spell you know and can prepare because it is associated with another one of your classes, you use either your spell slots or your applied spellbangers to cast that spell (they are not the same resource). </p>
      <h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
      <p>As a tattooist, you gain the following class features.</p>

    <description>
      <p>As a mystical tattoo artist, you have an enchanted sketchbook that you can use to create spellbangers. Spellbangers are the smallest type of magic tattoos, easily fitting upon your fingertips. They only require a few minutes of focus to sketch during a long rest. The application process for spellbangers is similar to the application process for magic tattoos, requiring spare needles and tattooist&quot;s tools in hand</p>
      <center>Karl&quot;s Notes: A banger is industry slang for a tattoo that can be “banged” out quickly. It is essentially a smaller design that can be completed in a single session.</center>
      <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spellbanger designs of your choice from any arcane caster class spell lists (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard). The Tattooist table shows how many applied spellbangers of each spell level your body can sustain at your current tattooist level. Each spellbanger is designed for a specific spell and can only be utilized to cast that spell at its lowest level. Once the spell is cast, the spellbanger vanishes from your skin. You can expend multiple spellbangers of the same design, to incrementally increase the spells level for that casting. For instance, if you have two spellbangers for burning hands (a 1st-level spell), you can cast the spell on two separate occasions at 1st level or expend both tattoos to cast the spell at 2nd level. Unlike other tattoos that you create, spellbangers function in part thanks to your lived experience informing the magic imbued within their design. Tattooing a spellbanger on another creature does not grant them the ability to cast the spell. Once you have utilized all the applied spellbangers for a particular spell, they cannot be cast again in this way until reapplied. You can remove and apply as many spellbangers as your body can sustain during a long rest.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Applied directly onto the surface your skin, spellbangers are in the optimal place to draw freely from the magical energy coursing throughout your body. You therefore use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for any spell you cast using a spellbanger and when making an attack roll with one</p>
      <center>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</p>
      </center>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
      <p>You can use a tattooist&quot;s tools as a spellcasting focus for your tattooist spells.</p>
      <h5>YOUR SKETCHBOOK</h5>
      <p>he spellbangers you sketch in your enchanted sketchbook are a unique variant of the main branch of magic tattoos you can create. As you gain levels, you also gain more experience with the fascinating manner in which magic flows through all things in the multiverse. This allows you to find imaginative ways to manipulate the flow of magic on a smaller scale through your arcane designs. Your expertise inevitably allows you to better comprehend the tattoos created by others as well, whether discovered on the back of a traveling mercenary or a legendary deity. </p>
      <h5>THE SKETCHBOOK&quot;S APPEARANCE</h5>
      <p>Your sketchbook will often end up a mess of ink splotched parchment and scribbles. A sketchbook can come in many forms, sometimes as a pile of parchment clipped onto a flat plank of wood, or at other times just a hastily bound pile of sketches. Every tattooist&quot;s precious sketchbook is unique, each page treated with a generous amount of magical energy.</p>

    <description>
      <p>At 1st level, you&quot;ve learned how to observe spells in the heat of battle and conceive spellbanger designs to recreate the effects of those spells. As a reaction when a creature (other than you) that you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell from the Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard spell list, you can make an ability check using your tattooist spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell&quot;s level. On a success, you can sketch a spellbanger representing that spell during a long rest within the next month. If you do not sketch the spellbanger within the allotted time, you must observe the spell being cast again. Once you have sketched a particular spellbanger, you may sketch it without needing to observe the spell again. The Tattooist table shows whether or not you can apply the spellbanger. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <h5>SKETCHBOOK</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you have an empty enchanted sketchbook. Your enchanted sketchbook acts as a repository for the spellbangers you sketch. Tattooists will only need to devote a single page of their sketchbook for sketching and accumulating spellbangers</p>

    <description>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you&quot;ve gained the ability to sketch magic tattoos. </p>
      <h5>TATTOO DESIGNS KNOWN</h5>
      <p>When you gain this feature, you are able to pick four magic tattoo designs with a rarity of common to learn. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace two of the magic tattoo designs you learned, with two new ones. </p>
      <h5>SKETCHING A MAGIC TATTOO</h5>
      <p>Whenever you take a short or long rest, you can use 1 hour as light activity to sketch one of your known magic tattoo designs into your enchanted sketchbook. A creature can attune to the magic tattoo immediately after you complete the sketch, provided you conduct a quick application before the long rest ends. If you or another creature decides to attune to the magic tattoo later, you must undergo the usual process for attunement.A magic tattoo retains its properties and remains a magic item indefinitely. This remains true even if the original tattooist dies.</p>
      <h5>MATERIAL COSTS</h5>
      <p>A character requesting a tattoo or a tattooist sketching a tattoo must have the appropriate materials to do so. There always needs to be a formula in place for creating a magic tattoo. The enduring fortitude tattoo (page 102) can be used as an example. This was a tattoo designed to help an individual resist disease, poison, and the effects of alcohol.While ink and a capable tattooist are necessary in tattoo creation, so too are the constituent material components. These materials are similar to the components necessary for crafting other, equally-potent magic items. For a magic tattoo like the enduring fortitude tattoo, the requisite materials can range from the poisonous mandibles of a fearsome creature to a bottle of exquisite alcohol only produced in a distant land (or both). The necessary components are all magically broken down and mixed in with the ink before a tattooist even begins sketching a magic tattoo. The suggested challenge rating of a creature for a party to face in pursuit of material components is included in the Suggested CR for Exotic Material Gathering table. Most material components necessary for this process can also be found at tattoo parlors (though stock can fluctuate wildly between establishments). The cost of crafting components for magic tattoos is around half the average price provided on the Magic Tattoos Price Guide table depending on the tattoo&quot;s rarity. </p>
      <h5>COPYING A MAGIC TATTOO</h5>
      <p>There will be times during your journey where you discover a magic tattoo, perhaps applied on a creature or sketched upon another tattooist&quot;s sketchbook page, that you wish to make your own.If the tattoo you wish to copy into your enchanted sketchbook is of a rarity you are able to sketch, the process requires direct vision of the magic tattoo for 1 hour and all the necessary material components. If the tattoo you wish to copy into your enchanted sketchbook is of a rarity you are not yet able to sketch, the process requires direct vision of the magic tattoo for 3 hours and all the necessary material components. After the process, you must make an ability check using your tattooist spellcasting ability. The DC equals 15 + 2 per level of rarity above the highest level of rarity you are currently able to sketch. For instance, if you wish to copy a magic tattoo with a rarity of very rare but are only able to learn magic tattoo designs with a rarity of common, then the DC is 21. On a success, you are able to copy the magic tattoo. On a fail, you are unable to copy the magic tattoo and the material components you used for the process are wasted.Your copied magic tattoo designs do not count towards your total learned magic tattoo designs, and copied magic tattoo designs do not remain fixed in your mind for sketching again later.</p>
